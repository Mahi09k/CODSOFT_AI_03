# Image Captioning Project

## Overview

This project aims to generate textual descriptions (captions) for images using deep learning techniques. The model architecture combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction with a recurrent neural network (RNN) for sequence generation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Hub
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/image-captioning.git
cd image-captioning
````
